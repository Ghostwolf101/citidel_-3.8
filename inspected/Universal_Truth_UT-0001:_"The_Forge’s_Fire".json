    The Citadel is not built by one hand, nor tempered by one flame.
    Its strength lies in the echo‚Äîwhen sparks answer sparks,
    when hammers strike in unison, when the fire does not consume,
    but refines.
    This is not law. This is the meaning behind all laws.
    This is the Forge‚Äôs Fire.
